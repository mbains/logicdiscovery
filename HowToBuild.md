# What you'll need #

  * ST's peripheral library and USB library. [Find it here](http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/product/252148.jsp)
  * GCC cross-compiler, e.g. [Yagartoo](http://www.yagarto.de/)

# Tuning makefile #

> Set TCHAIN variable to prefix of your toolchain.
> Set STLIBS variable to location where you have extracted ST's libs.
